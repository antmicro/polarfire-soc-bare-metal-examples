# HSS Payload Generator - sample configuration file
# Use this yaml file to run coremark on the four U54's.
#

# First, we can optionally set a name for our image, otherwise one will be created dynamically
set-name: 'PolarFire-SoC-HSS::TestCoremarkImages running on four U54 harts'

#
# Next, we'll define the entry point addresses for each hart, as follows:
#
hart-entry-points: {u54_1: '0x80000000', u54_2: '0x800A0000', u54_3: '0x80140000', u54_4: '0x801E0000'}

#
# Finally, we'll define some payloads (source ELF files) that will be placed at certain regions in memory
# The payload section is defined with the keyword payloads, and then a number of individual
# payload descriptors.
#
# Each payload has a name (path to its ELF file), an owner-hart, and optionally 1-3 secondary-harts.
#
# Additionally, it has a privilege mode in which it will start execution.
#  * Valid privilege modes are PRV_M, PRV_S and PRV_U.
#
#
#
# Case only matters for the ELF path names, not the keywords.
#
